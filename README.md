# Covid-Project-Data-and-Models

This project is for a course I am taking as part of my masters in data science. The model was created using Salford Predictive Modeling software. I have provided the Excel file for the data, the command file for which columns I chose to use in the analysis, and the predictive model that I have created so far. The model is a linear spline regression and can be easily coded in R or Python. Links to data:
